Innkeeper is a command-line tool designed to execute a specified command in all
directories that match a certain pattern within a given root directory. It
provides flexibility and efficiency in running commands across multiple
directories with customizable patterns.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install innkeeper
```

## Usage

```sh
Inn .git git fetch upstream
```

This command will fetch from upstream for all the .git repositories inside the
current directory. Essentially, it replaces the following shell command:

```sh
find -iname .git -type d -execdir git fetch upstream \;
```

To specify a `--File` argument or `-F`, if you would like to search for a file
instead of a directory, use:

```sh
Inn -F astro.config.ts npx astro add astro-compress
```

Additionally, you can provide a `--Root` argument or `-R` to set the current
working directory to a different folder. The default is `.`.

```sh
Inn -R D:\Developer .git git fetch upstream
```

Specify a `--Parallel` argument or `-P` if you would like to run commands in
parallel. The default is sequential.

```sh
Inn -P -R D:\Developer .git git fetch upstream
```

## Dependencies

The code imports several crates:

-   `clap` - For parsing command-line arguments.
-   `tokio` - Enables parallel execution of tasks.
-   `walkdir` - Facilitates filesystem traversal.
